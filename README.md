# Iris Dataset Clustering Project

This project explores clustering the Iris dataset using Python, scikit-learn, and the KMeans algorithm. We aim to find the optimal number of clusters for the data using the elbow method, a common technique to evaluate the best number of clusters (k) in unsupervised learning.

## Project Overview

The Iris dataset contains data on 150 iris plants across three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample includes measurements for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to cluster these samples based on the features, using KMeans clustering, to observe how well the data can be grouped without labels.

## Key Objectives

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and examine the dataset for any required preprocessing.
2. **Clustering with KMeans**: Apply the KMeans clustering algorithm from scikit-learn to identify clusters in the dataset.
3. **Optimal Number of Clusters**: Use the elbow method to determine the best value of `k` for clustering.
4. **Evaluation**: Visualize the clusters and evaluate how well KMeans clustering groups the dataset.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed, along with the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Load the Dataset**: Use pandas to load the Iris dataset for analysis.
2. **Run KMeans**: Apply the KMeans algorithm, experimenting with different values of `k`.
3. **Elbow Method**: Use the elbow method to find the optimal `k` by plotting the sum of squared distances for each cluster number.
4. **Cluster Visualization**: Plot the clusters for a visual understanding of the clustering effectiveness.

## Results

The elbow method should reveal an ideal `k` value that balances model accuracy with simplicity. Visualizations provide insight into the clustering structure within the Iris dataset.
